# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

0. 0-add.py: Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
1. 1-concat.py: Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string
2. 2-floor.py: Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.
3. 3-to_str.py: Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.
4. 4-define_variables.py: Define variables with specified values
5. 5-sum_list.py: Write a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.
6. 6-sum_mixed_list.py: Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
7. 7-to_kv.py: Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.
